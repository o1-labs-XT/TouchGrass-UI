## About
TouchGrass lets you join fun photo challenges where every image is proven real — no AI, no filters, no fakes. Just snap, prove, and share.

Built on **Mina Protocol**, TouchGrass gives you a glimpse into a future where all digital content can be cryptographically verified as authentic.

It’s a sneak peek at what’s coming: cameras and sensors attaching proofs and signatures to everything they capture, all anchored securely on Mina — the global proof settlement layer for verifiable apps.

## How to get started?
### 1️⃣ Choose how to play
- Quick Mode: Tap “Continue without wallet” to jump right in.  
    → We’ll create a secure key in your browser and store it locally (no setup needed).  
- Full Mode: Want rewards or to test Mina on-chain?  
    → Install [Auro Wallet](https://www.aurowallet.com/), on your mobile phone, then tap “Connect Wallet & Start Playing.”  
    *If Auro opens without showing TouchGrass, try tapping the link again from your default browser.

### 2️⃣ Join a Challenge
Pick a live challenge and upload your photo.  
You’ll need to post at least one photo before you can start liking others.

### 3️⃣ Have Fun 🌱
Explore, like your favorite posts, and share your own!  
Photos with 100+ likes are eligible for rewards 🎁

## What is really happening when I upload a photo?
Every image you post gets signed in the browser - proving it was really taken by you.  In the backend, we verify the signature against the actual content submitted to confirm the match, and then submit that proof to a smart contract on Mina.  Mina stores the SHA-256 hash and ECDSA signature in a token account that functions kind of like a soulbound NFT.
